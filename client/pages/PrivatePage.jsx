            Today, my fabulous camp group went to a (an) $$$$$$$ amusement park. It was a fun park with lots of cool $$$$$$$ and enjoyable play structures. When we got there, my kind counselor shouted loudly, "Everybody off the $$$$$$$." We all pushed out in a terrible hurry. My counselor handed out yellow tickets, and we scurried in. I was so excited! I couldn't figure out what exciting thing to do first. I saw a scary roller coaster I really liked so, I $$$$$$$ ran over to get in the long line that had about $$$$$$$ people in it. When I finally got on the roller coaster I was $$$$$$$. In fact I was so nervous my two knees were knocking together. This was the $$$$$$$ ride I had ever been on! In about two minutes I heard the crank and grinding of the gears. Thats when the ride began! When I got to the bottom, I was a little $$$$$$$ but I was proud of myself. The rest of the day went $$$$$$$. It was a(n) $$$$$$$ day at the fun park.
